Shoulder height ranges between three and four m.\nAdult male Asian elephants weigh between 1,800 and 4,500 kg (2 and 5 tons), with females weighing slightly less. Shoulder height ranges between 2 and 3.5 m.\nThe elephants trunk is an extension of the upper lip and nose. It functions for grasping, breathing, feeding, dusting, smelling, drinking, lifting, sound production/communication, defense/protection, and sensing.\nThe trunk contains an estimated 100,000 muscles and tendons in the trunk, giving it extreme flexibility and strength. Elephant trunks are capable of expanding, contracting, and moving in a diverse array of directions.\nAn adult Asian elephant can hold up to 8.5 L of water in its trunk. Water is sprayed into the mouth for drinking and onto the back to keep cool.\nSmall sensory hairs extend the length of the elephants trunk enhance its sensitivity.

Adult lion males are much\n    larger than females and usually have an impressive mane of hair around their neck. The color, size and abundance of the mane\n    vary between specimens and in relation to age. The function of the mane is to make males look more impressive to females and\n    more intimidating to rival males. The lions thick mane also protects its neck from its claws, during fights with other males,\n    in territorial or mating disputes. The lion is the only truly sociable cat that lives in groups whose size varies in size and\n    dynamics. Lions are nocturnal or twilight animals, spending most of their day, around 20 hours, resting. The reasons why they\n    spend so much time resting are due to the need to conserve energy, lack of prey, and to withstand the heat of the day.\n    The lion usually hunts by lurking and then catches prey. When it hunts and has no chance of catching prey, the lion will give\n    up its pursuit after 45-100 m.

(30, 'Polar bear', 'Ursus maritimus', 'Mammals', 'Polar bears can live 20 to 30 years, but only a sm', '\n  Polar bears are the largest carnivorous land mammals on Earth. They are about seven to eight feet long, measured from the nose to the tip of their very short tail. Male polar bears are much larger than the females. A large male can weigh more than 1,700 pounds, while a large female is about half that size (up to 1,000 pounds). Bears can weigh about 50 percent more after a successful hunting season than they do at the start of the next; most of this additional weight is accumulated fat. A newborn polar bear weighs only about 1.5 pounds.\n\nMany of the polar bears physical adaptations help it maintain body heat and deal with its icy habitat. The bears outer layer of fur is hollow and reflects light, giving the fur a white color that helps the bear remain camouflaged. The skin under the polar bears fur is actually black; this black is evident only on the nose. Polar bears also have a thick layer of fat below the surface of the skin, which acts as insulation on the body to trap heat. This is especially important while swimming and during the frigid Arctic winter. The bears large size reduces the amount of surface area thats exposed to the cold per unit of body mass (pounds of flesh), which generates heat.\n\nThe polar bears footpads have a kind of “non-slip” surface, allowing them to get traction on slippery ice. Polar bears have strong legs and large, flattened feet with some webbing between their toes, which helps with swimming and walking on ice. The wide paws prevent sea ice from breaking by distributing the polar bears weight as it walks. The webbed feet results in making polar bears, unlike other bear species, considered to be “marine mammals” along with seals, sea lions, walruses, whales, and dolphins. However, they are still bears. The polar bear evolved one to three million years ago from the brown bear, which still ekes out a marginal life along the northern shore of the Arctic oceans. Unlike the massive polar bear, which can grow huge on a diet of abundant seals, its ancestor in the Arctic is small, has very lower reproductive rates, and eagerly eats almost anything that exists in its environment.\n\nPolar bears have evolved something else that is different from their ancestor: most polar bears don’t den, however all brown bears do. When grizzly bear food is covered in snow during the winter, this species must den because there is nothing to eat. In contrast, most polar bears have access to their food of choice (seals) all winter long, so there is no need for them to den. The exception to this is pregnant adult females. Pregnant female polar bears must den so that their tiny newborn cubs are born in a warm protected environment; dens can be 38 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the outside temperature. The cubs would otherwise freeze to death in the frigid temperatures of the far north.\n  ', 'Polar bears are found throughout the circumpolar Arctic.\nPolar Bear Distribution and Habitat\nPolar bears, or their tracks, have been reported almost as far north as the pole; however, scientists believe few bears frequent areas north of 88° north latitude on the ice over the continental shelf. The northern Arctic Ocean has little food for them.\nThe polar bears southern range is limited by the amount of sea ice that forms in the winter. Polar bears prefer to travel on sea ice and must have ice from which to hunt seals.\nPolar bears inhabit arctic sea ice, water, islands, and continental coastlines.\nPolar bears prefer sea ice habitat with leads and polynyas, next to continental coastlines or islands.', 'Polar bears feed mainly on ringed and bearded seals. Depending upon their location, they also eat harp and hooded seals and scavenge on carcasses of beluga whales, walruses, narwhals, and bowhead whales.\nOn occasion, polar bears kill beluga whales and young walruses.\nWhen other food is unavailable, polar bears will eat just about any animal they can get, including reindeer, small rodents, seabirds, waterfowl, fish, eggs, vegetation (including kelp), berries, and human garbage.', 'Carnivorous', 'Arctic', 1, '../Imagini/polarbear.jpg'),

However, for \n        such large animals, their stomachs are relatively small. It feeds on fish, antelopes, zebras and even buffaloes, catching\n        and pulling nesting birds or mammals that come to water.\n    ', 'Carnivorous', 'Rivers', 1, '../Imagini/croco.jfif'),
(36, 'Porcupine', 'Hystrix cristata', 'Mammals', '27 years in the wild, 33 years in captivity', '\n        The porcupine is the third largest member of the rodent family. The name porcupine comes from the French word \"porc d\'epine\".\n        The body of this animal is round and covered with spines, and their color can be gray, brown or white. The thorns that cover\n        their bodies are keratin-coated hairs and are used to remove predators. Normally, these spines lie in a prone position, but\n        when the porcupine feels threatened, it rises. His snout is blunt and his eyes and ears are small. The legs of the porcupine\n        are small and robust, each with 5 toes that end in strong claws.\n   ', '\n       The porcupine lives in forests and forest steppes in subtropical and tropical regions. They also live at the foot of mountains, in the mountains, sometimes in the desert. It rises in the mountains up to 3900 m above sea level.\n    ', '\n       The porcupine is a herbivore, a rodent. It feeds on the underground and above-ground parts of plants, roots, bulbs, berries and fruits.\n    ', 'Herbivore', 'Forest', 0, '../Imagini/porcupine.jpg');
