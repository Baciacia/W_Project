    <h2><span></span>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Furry Park is a web-application for a zoo, and is meant to be user-friendly and eye candy.In our vision, it
        should allow the users to browse through animal information like an encyclopedia and it should be a virtual
        guide for the zoo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, we want large groups to be able to book their visit and a guide if they want.Individuals can buy
        tickets
        online to avoid waiting in line.To expand our zoo, we implemented a donation page for people to help us.
        For ease of access, users can create accounts, so they don't have to re-enter their personal data every
        time.

    <h2><span></span>Overall Description</h2>
    <p>
        Furry Park is based on HTML (the base of the site), CSS (for design elements), javascript (for dynamic and
        interactive content) and php for writing server-side web application logic and connect the application with the other web services.

        The site works according to the following rules: if you want to visit the zoo, you must first make a reservation (which is done
        by accessing the 'visit us' page in the navbar.After that you have the opportunity to support the zoo by equipping it with better
        equipment, elements that improve the lives of animals through donations, which is possible by filling in the form on the donation
        page that is on the side of the navbar.In order to make a plan with what to visit, what might interest you and all kinds of ideas,
        we suggest you access the 'animals' page in the navbar, where you will be able to see which animals are eager to see you. You can
        find out a lot of information about them, such as: scientific names, where they are found, if they are endangered, how long they
        live, what they eat and many other curiosities.If you want to save the info on your computer,press the Export JSON button(to save it
        as a json file) or on the Export button(to save it as a xml file).There is a secret feature for admins only: the import button,which
        will appear on the animals page only if an admin is logged in.The import button allows the user to add a new animal to our database,
        if the imported file is xml or json.
        If our zoo was enough to make you smile, we invite you to be part of our family,
        following just a few simple steps, that is to choose a username, a password, an email address to be up to date with all the
        information related to animals and press the sign up button at the bottom of the page or on one of our pictures in the carousel
        with pictures.
        There will be an error displayed if any field of the forms is filled incorrectly. At the same time we will limit the number of
        characters that can be written in forms to avoid modifying the database through the commands written in the boxes intended
        for writing the information by the visitor.
        If you are tired of us,you can always log out by pressing the log out button on the home page.

        This section demonstrates the website's most prominent features and explains how they can be used and the results they will
        give back to the user. The only solution to use the site is to have the database because it is a local one and otherwise you
        would not have the necessary information to make certain orders.
